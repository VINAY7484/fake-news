# INTRODUCTION

The enormous amount of data is produced on social networking in different formats of social media. There have been very large amounts of posts that have increases social media data on the web explosively. Many people discuss it on the web through social networking when some event has occurred. They are searching for or retrieving and discussing news incidents as the daily routine. However, very big volumes of news or posts caused users to face the issue of overloading data during search retrieving. Unreliable sources of data expose individuals to a dose of false news, hexes, rumors, theories of conspiracy and fake news. Fake news for different political and economic benefits occurs in large numbers following the successful development of online social media platforms. Several analytical experiments were performed using natural Language Processing (NLP) analytics to estimate the origins of false information or analyze the news text to characterize news as fake or accurate in different classifications. Current methods have detected false statements using other computer vision model, namely Naïve Bayes, KNN, SVM, etc. While there are several tools and techniques to identify fake news outlets, such as whether a website or person releases fake news, this problem can be discussed as an example of text analysis, utilizing news and information to function based on description, body, and context. Using it helps to identify a false statement by creating deep learning models. Specific parameter estimates will ensure higher predictive accuracy for the best results by tuning and regularly training the model. Security methods using deep neural networks can recognize fake news and prevent malicious writers from disseminating fake information. In comparison, this paper integrates the advantages of blockchain with machine learning techniques to identify and prevent the spread of false information in widespread communication.

# PROBLEM DEFINATION AND PROPOSED MODEL
## 2.1 PROBLEM DEFINITION
These days‟ fake news is creating different issues from sarcastic articles to a fabricated news and plan government propaganda in some outlets. Fake news and lack of trust in the media are growing problems with huge ramifications in our society. Obviously, a purposely misleading story is “fake news “but lately blathering social media’s discourse is changing its definition. Some of them now use the term to dismiss the facts counter to their preferred viewpoints. The importance of disinformation within American political discourse was the subject of weighty attention, particularly following the American president election. The term 'fake news' became common parlance for the issue, particularly to describe factually incorrect and misleading articles published mostly for the purpose of making money through page views. In this paper, it is sleeked to produce a model that can accurately predict the likelihood that a given article is fake news. Facebook has been at the epicentre of much critique following media attention. They have already implemented a feature to flag fake news on the site when a user sees’ it; they have also said publicly they are working on to distinguish these articles in an automated way. Certainly, it is not an easy task. A given algorithm must be politically unbiased – since fake news exists on both ends of the spectrum – and give equal balance to legitimate news sources on either end of the spectrum. In addition, the question of legitimacy is a difficult one. However, to solve this problem, it is necessary to have an understanding on what Fake News. This project aims to classify news articles as real or fake based on their content. Specifically, we will use machine learning to build a model to predict whether a given news article is real or fake based on its text.


## 2.2	OBJECTIVE
The objective of this project is to examine the problems and possible significances related with the spread of fake news. We will be working on different fake news data set in which we will apply different machine learning algorithms to train the data and test it to find which news is the real news or which one is the fake news. As the fake news is a problem that is heavily affecting society and our perception of not only the media but also facts and opinions themselves. By using the artificial intelligence and the machine learning, the problem can be solved as we will be able to mine the patterns from the data to maximize well defined objectives. So, our focus is to find which machine learning algorithm is best suitable for what kind of text dataset. Also, which dataset is better for finding the accuracies as the accuracies directly depends on the type of data and the amount of data. The more the data, more are your chances of getting correct accuracy as you can test and train more data to find out your results.
## 2.3	PROPOSED MODEL
In this project a model is build based on the count vectorizer or a TFI-DIF matrix (i.e.) word tallies relatives to how often they are used in other articles in your dataset) can help. Since this problem is a kind of text classification, implementing a Support Vector Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Naive Bayes classifier will be best as this is standard for text-based processing. The actual goal is in developing a model which was the text transformation (count vectorizer vs TFIDF vectorizer) and choosing which type of text to use (headlines vs full text). Now the 9 next step is to extract the most optimal features for count vectorizer or TFIDF-vectorizer, this is done by using a n-number of the most used words, and/or phrases, lower casing or not, mainly removing the stop words which are common words such as “the”, “when”, and “there” and only using those words that appear at least a given number of times in a given text dataset.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
